A simple WearOS Tile that will automagically pick a location, within 1km, for you to walk to. It'll launch Google Maps directions when you tap it. The picture is kinda special to me, it's AI art, but I use it to help ground myself as to who I am and what I want â™¥

You'll need to put your Google Maps API key into a `secrets.properties` file that you need to create beside `local.properties`
You can get an API key here: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
